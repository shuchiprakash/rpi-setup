 We will install xdrp and in order to install xdrp, we shall install tightvncserver package
 sudo apt install tightvncserver -y
Once that is complete, we can install xrdp
sudo apt install xdrp -y
We also need samba so we can access the RPI hostname
sudo apt install -y samba

Goto WIndows- Remote desktop connection and type your rpi IP address and name


Samba- file sharing between windows and linux
rdp- protocol which windows specific; windows native- login on windows to login to other windows/linux GUI
vnc-separate protocol( client is required on windows because it is not windows native to access linux)
sudo apt install xdrp -y
sudo apt install tightvncserver -y

Check currently background running process
ps(para system)
ps aux (to get list of running process)
ps aux | grep rdp(grep command powerful filter)
ps aux | grep -i rdp (for case insensitive, add -i)

netstat antp ( on that system what all ports are open)
 netstat -antp | grep :5500   (to filter we have pipe it with grep(filter))
 
 Log file is /home/pi/.vnc/raspberrypi:1.log
